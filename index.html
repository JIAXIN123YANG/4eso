    <h2> My Uncle Jules
Guy de Maupassant
A white-haired old man begged us for alms. My companion, Joseph Davranche, gave him
five francs. Noticing my surprised look, he said:
"That poor unfortunate reminds me of a story which I shall tell you, the memory of which
continually pursues me. Here it is:
"My family, which came originally from Havre, was not rich. We just managed to make
both ends meet. My father worked hard, came home late from the office, and earned very
little. I had two sisters.
"My mother suffered a good deal from our reduced circumstances, and she often had harsh

"Then we set out ceremoniously. My sisters marched on ahead, arm in arm. They were of
